      <h1>About Myself</h1>

      My name is Abdul Rahman Ali, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of
      Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science Engineering. I consider myself a
      curious learner, someone who enjoys exploring new ideas, understanding how
      things work, and finding ways to solve real-world problems using
      technology. Academic Interests Being a computer science student, I have
      developed a strong interest in programming, problem-solving, and
      application development. I like working on projects that have a practical
      impact, such as building apps that help students or communities. For
      example, I have been working on ideas like a college event management app
      to simplify event registrations, and a room and flat-finding app for
      students and low-income groups, which would include agreements, details,
      and easy access to affordable housing. Projects like these excite me
      because they combine technology with human needs. Apart from computer
      science, I also take an interest in subjects like mathematics, chemistry,
      and engineering graphics, as I believe these areas broaden my thinking and
      problem-solving skills. Even though some subjects may not seem directly
      connected to computer science, I like to explore how they play a role in
      shaping an engineer’s mindset. Personal Interests Beyond academics, I am
      deeply interested in history, psychology, and motivational books. History
      teaches me about the struggles and achievements of civilizations,
      psychology helps me understand human behavior and thought processes, and
      motivational books inspire me to push beyond limitations and think
      positively in every situation. I also enjoy learning about industrial
      growth and rural development. Since I live in a village that already has
      good infrastructure like roads, electricity, and transportation, I often
      think about how small businesses and manufacturing units could create jobs
      and empower local communities. For instance, I have explored ideas such as
      making incense sticks (agarbatti), candles, diyas, and other small-scale
      manufacturing businesses that could help people, especially my mother,
      start an independent livelihood. Values and Personality I believe in
      continuous growth — whether it is through formal education, practical
      projects, or personal experiences. I value hard work, creativity, and the
      willingness to learn from mistakes. I also strongly believe in helping
      others and contributing to society in meaningful ways. For me, technology
      is not just about machines or codes; it is about solving problems and
      improving lives. I am also someone who adapts to challenges. For example,
      even when I face difficulties in academics, such as limited guidance in
      certain subjects, I make efforts to learn independently, practice
      regularly, and improve my skills. This self-motivated attitude helps me
      stay focused on my long-term goals. Future Goals In the future, I want to
      establish myself as a professional who can combine innovation with social
      impact. My dream is not only to build a successful career in technology
      but also to create solutions that make education, housing, and livelihood
      opportunities accessible to more people. I aspire to contribute to the
      vision of a “Viksit Bharat” (Developed India) by participating in projects
      that focus on industrial growth, digital innovation, and rural
      development. ✨ In short, I see myself as a learner, a dreamer, and a doer
      who wants to use knowledge and creativity to bring positive changes in
      society.
